Welcome to Cocktail Fix! üçπ

Cocktail Fix is a simple terminal app to help you pick a cocktail to make at home. Very helpful when you can't figure out which cocktail you want to make on a Thursday evening, when you're trying different drinks with friends or even for learning some nifty alcoholic recipes.

Here's how it works:

1. Just enter the liquor or ingredient that you have laying around your bar and the app will suggest cocktails you could make with it. 
2. Choose one of the given options to see the full recipe. 
3. If you're so fancy that you happen to have a liquor for which the app has no recipes, like cynar or mal√∂rt, you'll have the option to choose again; just for tonight's drinking purposes, pick something a bit more pedestrian - come on, if you have cynar ready at hand, you're bound to have a bottle of whiskey or vodka there too, and for these we do have plenty of cool recipes.
4. You'll always get the chance to search for another recipe.
5. When you're done, just tell the app you don't want to search for any other recipes, and our app will bid you farewell.

Made with entry-level knowledge of Python and best intentions only. 

Bottoms up!
